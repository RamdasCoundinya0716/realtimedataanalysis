1) KAFKA Download ->wget https://downloads.apache.org/kafka/3.4.1/kafka_2.13-3.4.1.tgz
2) Extract -> tar -xvf kafka_2.13-3.4.1.tgz
3) Java Instal -> 3.1) # Update the system  sudo yum update
		  3.2) # Install the Amazon Corretto JDK   sudo yum install java-17-amazon-corretto-devel
		  3.3) # Verify that Java is installed correctly   java -version

4) Start Zoo-keeper: bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
5) Start Kafka-server:
	Duplicate the session & enter in a new console --
	export KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS="-Xmx256M -Xms128M"
	cd kafka
	bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
6) There is a problem here. It is pointing to private server , change server.properties so that it can run in public IP to access outside the network.
To do this , you can follow any of the 2 approaches shared below --
Do a "sudo vi config/server.properties" - change advertised.listeneres to public ip of the EC2 instance (Do this process everytime as AWS reassigns public IP addresses to EC2 instances whenever they are stopped and started. This is done to ensure that there is a sufficient pool of public IP addresses available for all EC2 instances.)

To avoid this use you can use an Elastic IP address (EIP).
To use EIP, follow these steps: 
	1) Open the AWS Management Console and go to the EC2 console.
	2) In the navigation pane, choose Elastic IPs.
	3) Choose Allocate new address.
	4) Choose the public IP address pool that you want to allocate the EIP from.
	5) Choose Allocate.
	6) Click on the IP address.Then click on "Associate Elastic IP address".
	7) Choose the EC2 instance that you want to associate the EIP with.
	8) Choose Associate.
Once you have associated an EIP with your EC2 instance, you can start and stop the instance without the public IP address changing.

7) Create the topic:
Duplicate the session & enter in a new console --
cd kafka
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic test_topic --bootstrap-server {Public IP of your EC2 Instance:9092} --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1

8) Start Producer:
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic test_topic --bootstrap-server {Put the Public IP of your EC2 Instance:9092}

9) Start Consumer:
Duplicate the session & enter in a new console --
cd kafka
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic demo_testing2 --bootstrap-server {Put the Public IP of your EC2 Instance:9092}
